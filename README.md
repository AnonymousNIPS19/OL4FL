### OL4FL: Online learning for federated learning in heterogeneous edge-cloud collaborative systems

OL4FL was implemented in Java. 

We encapsulated the Java codes for both edge servers and the Cloud using docker containers, and implemented the containers in a edge-Cloud testbed system consisting of three mini personal computers as the edge servers and a workstation as the Cloud server. 

Edge and Cloud servers are connected using Transmission Control Protocol(TCP) sockets.
